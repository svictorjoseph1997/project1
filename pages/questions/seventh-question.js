      <h1>What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask
Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common
problems, short-term and long-term?</h1>

        <p>I believe the most common problem the customer faces is to get started with the product. The best way to overcome this problem is by creating a step by step video tutorials and using a Community Support Forum to address all the doubts that customer has.</p>
